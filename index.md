### 5.1-5.6 TPT Notes
**Beneficial and Harmful Effects (5.1)**

_5.1.1_
- Accelerometer: a sensor to detect acceleration. Used in cars for airbag release. 
- Computer innovations have beneficial and harmful effects on people, and not everything is anticipated in advance. 

_5.1.2_
- As not all the harmful effects can be predicted, responsible programmers think ahead, as much as they can.  

**Digital Divide (5.2)**
- Digital divide - refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet based on your income, location, your demographic and more. Raises issues of equity and equality people some have advantages over others. 

**Computing Bias (5.3)**
- Explicit Data -voluntarily giving data about yourself
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases written into the algorithm or biases in the data used by the innovation. 
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovation (if they really deserve it) as a way of combating existing human biases.  

**Crowdsourcing (5.4)**
- Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems. 
- Citizen science is the scientific research conducted in a whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists. Who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices. 
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing. 
- Crowdsourcing- the practice of obtaining information or input into a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the internet.
- Offer new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding. 

**Legal and Ethical Concerns (5.5)**
- Copy right protects intellectual property unless you allow it. 
- The legal way to use other people’s content is by following the license that they have on their property. 
- Creative Commons -  tells what you can or can’t do with the property. It is a license. 
- Open-source - programs that are free on the internet
- Open Access - online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of restrictions on access and free of restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions. 

**Safe Computing (5.6)**

_5.6.1_
- Personally Identifiable Information is information about an individual. Hackers can steal these.

_5.6.2_
- Authentication measured protect devices and information from unauthorized access. 
- Authentication measured includes strong passwords and multi-factor authentication 
- Viruses modify the operating system and allow anyone without the correct authorization to enter into your accounts. Malware damages a system and poses to be the original system itself.
- Encryption - the coded message that holds data. It prevents unauthorized malware from accessing data that they are not supposed to. 
- Symmetric - one key used to both encrypt and decrypt data. Sender and receiver both know this key
- Asymmetric - Public key encryption: uses two keys. The public key for encrypting and a private key for decrypting. 
- The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message. 
- The receiver’s private key IS required to decrypt the message. 
- The sender uses the receiver’s public key to encrypt the message. The receiver only had the private key, so they can only decrypt the encrypted message.
- Digital Certificate: certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of the encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. 
- Decryption - decoding an encrypted message.  

_5.6.3_
- Phishing: An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information. 
- Keyloggers: records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information. 
- Rogue Access Point: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks. When data is being sent in a network, the hacker could steal in on the way there, before it reaches the secure location.

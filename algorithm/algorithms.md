# Algorithm
### An algorithm typically means 'code' that solves a problem.  Designing an algorithm can take many forms.

## A Linear Sequence of code.  Executions is from top to bottom.
### The [lists.py](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/blob/master/algorithm/lists.py) is a sequence of code interacting with lists.

## A Procedure is a set of block of code instructions that is abstracted from larger body.  A procedure performs is called from lager body and typically performs a talks with given paramters and returns a result.
### The [image.py](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/blob/master/algorithm/image.py) has multiple procedures (Python def), these procedures are called by 'main' tester at the bottoom of the file.  Also, we are all familiar with the Image Labs where we called these procedures from the Frontend.
### The [bitwise.py](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/blob/master/algorithm/bitwise.py) has procedures associated with 'Truth Tables'.  This procedure was generated and shared with students working on the Logic Gates lab.  This file has a 'main' to enable testing and viewing 'Truth Table'.
